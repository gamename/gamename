## Who Am I?
I'm a retired software engineer who is constantly tinkering on new home automation projects. I tend to focus on projects that involve things like esp32 microcontrollers, ws2812b LED strips, RGB LEDs, machine learning, and Raspberry Pi's. I make heavy use of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Over the years, I found that putting everything in repositories on my account became a little restrictive. There was no good way to associate multiple repos with a single, overarching project. So with that in mind, I started using organizations to group repos. Some of the organizations I have are: 

- [Cat Doorbell](https://github.com/cat-doorbell-v4) - Decommissioned Google Pixel phones that are hacked to sense when a cat is meowing, then verify a cat is "seen" by the camera, which then causes an SMS text message to be forwareded to me.
- [Chicken Coop Door Status](https://github.com/chicken-coop-door-status) - Save little chicken lives by verifying doors are closed at the correct times of the day.
- [WS2812b Strip Lights](https://github.com/esp32-led-strip-lights) - Various projects to control LED light strips
- [Garage Notifier](https://github.com/garage-notifier) - Let me know when my garage door opens/closes by sending a text message
- [Gate Sensor](https://github.com/gate-sensor-v1) - Keep me informed when a back gate is open or closed
- [Mailbox Notifier](https://github.com/gate-sensor-v1) - Tell me when the (snail) mailbox is open/closed/ajar via text messages
- [Water Bowl Notifier](https://github.com/waterbowl-notifier) - Monitor the contents of pet waterbowls. Text me when then need filling.  Provide additional feedback via a small LED on the device as well.
